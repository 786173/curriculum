This is a collection of modern resources on various undergrad level computer science topics, for someone with an interest in theory. Use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis][LibGen]] if you can't buy these books. You don't have to do everything here, just the topics of interest to you. Almost all the material in each resource is self contained
so will cover necessary background but being these resources are university level they will assume the student to be familiar with calculus. See [[Preliminaries]] section.  

** Accreditation
It's possible to earn an accredited BSc degree online if you want to attend a graduate school to do research. [[https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/][University of The People]] offers a BSc in Computer Science, and is the cheapest fully remote option. UoPeople is only accredited nationally in the US, but there exists [[https://www.cmu.edu/global/presence/][worldwide degree granting campuses]] to get around the regional accreditation requirement of US grad schools.
UoPeople is structured with 5 terms per academic year, with F/T students taking 2 courses per term or P/T students taking 1 course per term. [[http://www.open.ac.uk/][Open University]](OU) in the UK offers Computer Science to students in the UK/EU and select other regions with testing centers, and other degrees like [[http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/q36][Applied Math w/Statistics]] BSc(Hons) worldwide. The [[https://csc.uis.edu/program-information][University of Illinois]], [[https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-software-engineering][Arizona State]], [[https://ufonline.ufl.edu/degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/][University of Florida]], and [[https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-development-bachelors-program.html][Western Governor's University]] are some of the schools that 
offer US regionally accredited fully online degrees. Before you apply to any of these schools, research them to make sure they are financially sound so won't disappear half way through your degree, and that the type of accrediation they offer will work for your future plans. Also consider [[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32821678][free tuition]] for international students in countries like Germany.

An alternative strategy if the goal is grad school: do the theory courses here, contact graduate programs asking if they allow non-degree students to take their classes. Taking classes as a non-degree student will let you build up a formal academic background with recommendation letters in your chosen field to make this direct entry to PhD possible but of course you will have to pay for these classes yourself.   
Prepare a proper grad school [[http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2009/12/reading-phd-applications.html][application]] and remember this is a big risk for a department, especially if the department you're applying to is small and therefore needs to be more selective in who they admit. Anything you can do to show that you won't be a risk for them in your letter of intent will help your application.


** How to Learn
On Isaac Newton's iteration method to self-learn geometry:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 "He bought Descartes' Geometry and read it by himself .. when he was got over 2 or 3 pages he could understand no farther, than he began again and got 3 or 4 pages father till he came to another difficult place, than he began again and advanced farther and continued so doing till he made himself master of the whole without having the least light or instruction from anybody"
  (King's Cam.,Keynes MS 130.10,fol. 2/v/) 
#+END_QUOTE

Cal Newport has some anecdotes on how he was able to get the [[http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/25/case-study-how-i-got-the-highest-grade-in-my-discrete-math-class/][best grade]] in his Discrete Mathematics class, and the rest of the site is full of advice on studying, how to schedule yourself and [[http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/][deliberate practice]]. Further anecdotes exist on the importance of deep work and [[https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/][deliberate practice]]. There is a free course [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn][Learning How to Learn]] on coursera.org which suggest the same techniques plus Cornell style note taking and how to read a [[https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-read-a-paper.html][research paper]]. Attempt as many [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_set][psets]], textbook exercises, and any old exams you can to verify to yourself you understand the material.  

* Preliminaries
If you live near or wish to vacation to Raleigh NC (or possibly remote, ask him), for $500 (or see group rates when available) per course, you can hire this former CMU professor to [[https://calculem.us/][teach]] you directly as a guided tutor introductory computer science regardless of your educational background covering [[https://calculem.us/classes/trees/][functional]] data structures and other topics.  
Some of this material exists in lecture notes [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s16/schedule.html][here]] from when he taught 15-122 /Principles of Imperative Computation/. I did have access to the lecture recordings at one point before they got paywalled and they are fantastic. It's a steal for only $500 to have a PhD give you guided personal instruction.  

** Intro to Programming
Any of these options will suffice you don't have to do every resource.

*** Common Lisp Intro 
It's possible to do (or at least model) every course in this list using Common Lisp, such as building your own domain-specific [[https://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2014/03/15/sbcl-the-ultimate-assembly-code-breadboard/][machine code]] while completing 15-213 /Computer Systems/, or hacking together [[https://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/FSet-Tutorial.html][purely]] functional [[https://common-lisp.net/project/funds/funds.pdf][data structures]], or writing your own pattern matcher, or simulating a turing machine, ect.  
Of course you will do the courses using their recommended languages and tools, but in addition to this, building your own toy prototypes for the topics here in CLisp can help you learn this material as per this axiom[[Introduction to Pure Mathematics]] "people learn more when they discover something for themselves than they do if someone tells them about it." 
Another reason is the language hasn't changed much in decades, so older books which are now free, can be used. 

- [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/][(Book) Common Lisp - A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation]]
 - This book assumes no knowledge of programming and starts from pen and paper to writing complete programs.  
 - A good sequel is [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp][PAIP]] by Norvig and [[http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html][On Lisp]] by PG
  - For example the straight-forward [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/blob/master/docs/chapter13.md][description]] of OOP compared to other confusing large books attempting to teach Object-Oriented Programming   

*** Little Schemer 
The [[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/][Little Schemer series]] books are a Q&A format/Socratic method for learning the basics of computation (read the Preface of each book). You can do the Little Schemer with pencil and paper in a weekend though the authors recommend at least 3 sittings. The first in the series is /The Little Schemer/ which teaches you to think recursively.
The second is the /Seasoned Schemer/ covering higher-order functions, which will help understand calculus. The differential operator is a higher-order function: given a function on the real line it yields its first derivative as a function on the real line. 

- [[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTML/][(Book) The Little MLer - Matthias Felleisen, Daniel P. Friedman]]
 - Self contained but will make much more sense if you've already done the first book,  /The Little Schemer/ covering cons, lists and recursion. 
 - Teaches you to think recursively, and provides an introduction to the principles of types, computation, and program construction.
 - Applies to any functional language, almost all the exercises can be done in OCaml or another language with a small amount of syntactic adjustment.

*** CMU's Fundamentals of Programming
Students who go directly to this course already have a background in programming. I did this course in Common Lisp, using a simple wrapper for tcl/tk similar to Python's tkinter and wrote my own toy data structures as they were explained. 
Good information here on style, design and efficiency, with an introduction to [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-limits-of-computation.html][complexity]]. 

- [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/schedule.html][(Full Course) 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science]]
 - Click on each lecture topic, there are short youtube videos explaining each topic. 
 - The homework assignments are self-correcting, with assert statements and a linter doing static analysis
  - Some [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15131/f16/][notes]] on editors and version control (git), how to write a good [[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][commit comment]].
  - The sequel to this is 15-122, which teaches a variant of C but uses [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/schedule.shtml][contracts]] to prove imperative programs are correct. 

** Elementary Math 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it’s a all men’s school, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
  In high school, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas ([[https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJTYVOE94R83/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0201077795][second edition]]), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
  Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. 
  But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that /I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems/"
 ([[https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006][Don Knuth]] )
#+END_QUOTE

Start with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po-Shen_Loh][Po-Shen Loh's]] new site [[https://www.expii.com/][Expii]].com which presents topics in a brief intuitive manner, then feeds you problems in that domain and makes decisions based on your answers if you need more practice problems. The Advanced Topics have all kinds of great tutorials on CS Theory as well as Number Theory.
While you go through Expii, do a survey of The [[https://betterexplained.com/ebook/math/][Better Explained]] Math and Calculus series books, which explain basic math such as the natural logarithm then you can practice Calculus on Expii. Gilbert Strang also has a lecture series [[https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/][Highlights of Calculus]] for more intuition and a free [[https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/][book]].

** Calculus With Theory   
Optional, though doing the exercises of Apostol's /Calculus I/ however is a great way to build [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity][mathematical maturity]].
This alternative Calculus w/Theory lecture [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB][series]] only uses a simple algebraic framework, eliminating limits/infinity. Linear algebraic ideas and the Discrete Calculus are both highly relevant to the material here. There is also a [[https://www.openlearning.com/courses/algebraic-calculus-one][full course]] available. 

- [[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-014-calculus-with-theory-fall-2010/][MIT 18-014 Calculus w/Theory]]
 - Uses Apostol's /Calculus, Volume 1: One-Variable Calculus, with An Introduction to Linear Algebra/ (buy the international version on Amazon for $20)
 - Read [[https://math.vanderbilt.edu/schectex/commerrs/][Common Errors in Undergrad Math]] like undistributed cancellations, sign errors, confusion about notation ect.

* Discrete Mathematics
Resources to learn undergrad Discrete Mathematics. 
** Introduction to Pure Mathematics

- [[https://infinitedescent.xyz/][(Book) An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics]]
 - Collection of excellent lecture notes used in CMU's 15-151/21-127 Concepts of Mathematics class 
 - Curriculum based on findings in evidenced based teaching
 - Author's motivations for not including answers are explained [[https://infinitedescent.xyz/20180214-exercises-ibl/][here]]: "people learn more when they discover something for themselves than they do if someone tells them about it."
  - You may also find as you write your questions on math.stackexchange, that half way through writing you discover the answer yourself

** Discrete Math with Standard ML
The merging of proof and program is what makes this a great book. If you can't get this book /Discrete Mathematics/, by L. Lovász, J. Pelikán, and K. Vesztergombi is normally [[http://www.math.cmu.edu/~lohp/2013-228.shtml][used]] or just skip to 15-251 /Great Theoretical Ideas in CS/

- [[https://cs.wheaton.edu/~tvandrun/dmfp/][(Book/Lectures) Discrete Mathematics and Functional Programming - Thomas VanDrunen]]
 - Lectures exist on the author's homepage, this book is used for a one semester university course with additional elective chapters in Graph Theory, Complexity Theory, Automata, ect. 
 - List of [[https://math.vanderbilt.edu/schectex/commerrs/][Common Errors in Undergrad Math]] like undistributed cancellations, sign errors, confusion about notation ect. if you missed it from the prelims section of this guide
   - /The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1: Fundamental Algorithms/ by Donald E. Knuth also offers an excellent crash course in Discrete Math in the 1.1 and 1.2.x chapters.

** Rigorous Introduction to Computation 
15-251 assumes students have completed /An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics/ though it is self contained. "This course teaches the mathematical underpinnings of computation and explores some of the central results and questions regarding the nature of computation."

- [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15251f15/schedule.html][(Full Course) 15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science]]
 - Recorded lectures if you click each topic, backup YouTube [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3aafQm568blS9blxtA_EWQv][lectures]] and [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/notes.html][course notes]]
 - Public access to recitation solutions and also can try the exercises in the course notes and old exams
 - Some more material on the most [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/schedule.html][recent]] course schedule such as [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/notes/induction-pitfalls.pdf][induction pitfalls]]
  - (Optional) MIT 6.042j /Mathematics for Computer Science/ recorded [[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/][lectures]] and [[https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf][course notes]] 
 

* Abstract Algebra
It is possible in a functional language like SML to do algebra with types, proving two types are isomorphic with the desired properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. It's also possible to abstract Lists and Trees into polynomials, as every polynomial looks like a sum of terms.
As you will learn in 15-150 /Principles of Functional Programming/ "most functional datastructures have constant time access near the outer layer of their structure, ie: the head of a list or the root of a tree. However, access at some random point inside the structure is typically linear since looking at some element of a list is
linear in the length of the list, and looking at some element of a tree is linear in the depth of the tree. Datatype derivatives allow constant time access to the entire structure." 
 
** Linear Algebra
Though Apostol's /Calculus/ has an excellent introduction to Linear Algebra, these resources focus more on mathematical abstraction.  

- [[http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387940991][(Book) Linear Algebra: An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics - Robert J. Valenza]]
 - Similar to Valenza's text is this free [[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/index.html][book]] /Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics/ which you can use if you can't find Valenza's text 
 - These YouTube presentations [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab][here]] help with understanding the topics on a geometric level. Watch the [[https://youtu.be/kjBOesZCoqc?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab][Essence of Linear Algebra]] to see what this means
  - Sheldon Axler additionally has [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw][recorded lectures]] for his book /Linear Algebra Done Right/ aka Down With Determinants!

** Abstract Algebra  
- [[https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/371F14/hw-371SchedTab.html][(Full Course) Math-371 Abstract Algebra]]
 - Has recorded lectures which are essential as you can quickly get lost in the texts at this level of abstraction
 - Uses readings from [[https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/371F14/info.html#texts][three texts]]  
  - There is also this [[http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra][Harvard course]] with excellent recorded lectures and uses readings from /Algebra - M. Artin/ (blue book) as a great compliment to Math-371 lectures 
 - The [[http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/algebra/history.html][history]] of Abstract Algebra by Prof Lee Lady 

* Principles of Functional Programming
The "functional" part in functional programming refers to mathematical functions, meaning functions where each input has a single output.  The 2012 version by [[http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/][Dan Licata]] has the best lecture notes, optionally combine with most [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/lect.html][recent]] course notes. Robert Harper keeps a [[https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/intro-curriculum-update/ ][blog]] and a follow up [[https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-dog-that-didnt-bark/][post]] on the success of teaching this course.
SML is used because it's syntax and module system is simple, much like Scheme's easy syntax was once preferred for introductory courses so the complexity of the language gets out of the way and you learn the fundamentals. This course introduces you to programming with types, proving properties of programs, writing programs for parallel evaluation, and you'll find it surprisingly very intuitive making it easy to grok large programs.

- [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/previous-semesters/2012-spring/lect.html][(Lecture Notes) 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming]]
   - "PSML Chapters" are assigned reading from this book [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf][Programming in Standard ML]] an excellent book.
   - Can pair these notes with the recorded lectures from Unit 1 through 4 (specific to SML) at [[http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/16sp/#lectures][CSE341 (UW)]]
   - Do the [[https://github.com/functionalCS/15150labs][labs and homework]] plus any exercises you find in the PSML book. Try the CSE341 [[http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/16sp/#homeworks][homework]]
   - Note [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/previous-semesters/2012-spring/tools.html][emacs setup]] also [[http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/16sp/#software][here]] (if you use emacs)
   - Read this post about [[https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/it-is-what-it-is-and-nothing-else/][what recursion is]] if you struggle with it then complete [[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTML/][The Little MLer]] or /The Little Schemer/ book
    - Try [[http://mlton.org/][MLton]], one of the few whole program optimizing compilers, and used to build the [[http://www.redprl.org/en/latest/][RedPRL]] proof assistant

* Computer Systems
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes...and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use." (Hal Abelson) 
#+END_QUOTE

This covers computer architecture from a programmer's perspective, such as how to write cache friendly code, and other optimizations for the x86-64 arch. You learn how to manually write loops in assembly 
and see how recursion works at a lower abstraction. You learn machine code instructions, how compilers work, return oriented programming (ROP) to bypass stack protections, the memory hierarchy, and networks. You could read K&R's 
/The C Programming Language/ for a brief intro, though this course will explain C as you go anyway and fully covers pointers at the assembly language level making it self contained.

  - (Optional) An [[http://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/schedule.html][advanced class]] w/recorded lectures on building your own dbms, that uses autonomous dbms [[https://db.cs.cmu.edu/projects/peloton/][Peloton]].   

* Meta-Linguistic Abstraction 
A classic introductory computer science book on thinking about the big picture of programs with abstraction: finding general patterns from specific problems and building programs based on these patterns. An applied example of this is the package manager [[http://dustycloud.org/misc/talks/guix/chicagolug_2015/guix_talk.html][GNU Guix]] and distro GuixSD, which is a GNU implementation of the NixOS [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4584.pdf][functional software deployment model]]. 
Package builds, including entire system builds, are declared in one text file. The resulting software deployment is functional: build inputs go in such as compilers, customizations, environments ect, and a reproducible, immutable build comes out with a hashed identifier meaning you 
can do roll backs to previous successful builds. A recent GUixSD feature [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00833.pdf][gexp]] (g-expressions) is a good example what can be achieved through syntactic extensions of the Scheme language. 

You are more likely to benefit from this book after having some programming experience, but no matter what [[https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/350028210551013376?lang=en][level]] of programmer you are you'll still benefit from SICP.

* Algorithms 
** Introduction to Parallel and Sequential Algorithms
Unlike a traditional introduction to algorithms and data structures, this puts an emphasis on thinking about how algorithms can do multiple things at once instead of one at a time and ways to design to exploit these properties. It uses a language based analysis model to estimate complexity for abstractions such as garbage collection.
Most of the self learning and discovery is done through the labs, try them.

- [[http://www.parallel-algorithms-book.com/][(Book) Parallel and Sequential Algorithms]]
  - Complete, self-contained book with exercises used for [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./15210/schedule.html][15-210]]
  - Old exams, homework and labs w/solutions are [[https://github.com/functionalCS/15210labs][here]] and done in Standard ML 

** Advanced Algorithms (Purely Functional Data Structures)
The typical text for a senior undergrad or graduate course on algorithm analysis is /The Design and Analysis of Algorithms/ by Kozen (1992). This is an excellent book to study with difficult problems well presented and clearly analyzed by Kozen. The Okasaki book (1999), /Purely Functional Data Structures/ gives examples in Standard ML and Haskell.
